# Javascript Fundamentals II [Mikael Eriksson]

#### Data Types

- Boolean // true or false
- Numbers // numeric values
- Strings // "this is a string"  <====> "1"
- operators // (+) (-) (%) (/) (*=) (-=) (+=)  operators we can use for Arithmetic calculations.

- List // Are arrays containing either strings numbers or objects
- Keys and values // refer to objects (key) => car = (properties =>) color: #888

#### functions


- Functions is a block of code which is assigned to a specific task.
- Functions are resuable and can be called upon in different scenarios .



#### scope

- global scope
- local scope
#### Arrays

- Arrays is a data structure and represents a list of elements ex. (objects,strings,numbers).

#### array functions

- push() // pushes a elements to a array
- filter() // filter out x amount elements in a descending order
- map() // create a new array with the pre-existing elements
- pop() // remove a elements from the array



#### conditions



#### Objects

- Objects is code block with a set of properties and methods
- Ex. let Car = { model: Mercedes color: blue  };
- When we work with big dataset, objects  is a more efficient  way to structure data then just using a array.

- The name of a object is called a key.

- To access a object we use key name to access and modify or add new properties of the object. (Example below)how to access and manipulate properties.
